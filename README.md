"Eat Safe, Love"
In this project, I worked with a MongoDB database containing UK food establishment data. I started by importing the data into a new database and verified the connection using Python in a Jupyter notebook. I added a missing restaurant (Penang Flavours), updated its business type, removed all entries from Dover (as requested), and cleaned up the data by converting certain fields to the correct data types.

For the analysis portion, I explored the data to answer several questions:

Found all establishments with a hygiene score of 20.

Identified businesses in London with a rating of 4 or higher.

Located the five highest-rated places near Penang Flavours, sorted by cleanliness.

Ranked local authorities by the number of establishments with a hygiene score of 0.

Throughout, I used MongoDB queries and pandas to organize and display the results.
